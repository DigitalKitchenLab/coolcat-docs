> Welcome to CoolCat! On this page you can find information on the social side of CoolCat including details on how player-owned guilds will work and much more

Gaming is a social activity and CoolCat will provide social capabilities integrated into the product’s blockchain and apps.

There will be no need for gamers to organize and communicate via third party applications – each user will have a unique profile with their own on-chain identity. This can be pseudonymous and no one needs to divulge any personal information they do not want to share.

- Users can add one another to their friends lists and communicate via the built-in secured and truly privacy preserving peer-to-peer messenger.
- Users can create or join clowders, CoolCat’s take on guilds, with their own governance system and treasury, allowing full control of the clowder’s acquired resources in the most transparent way possible.

CoolCat aims to provide a robust and flexible system where you can socialize, work together and have fun with your friends while earning additional value through gaming.
