The focus of CoolCat is providing a fun to use gaming network supported by a welcoming community of gamers and game developers of all origins. Triple-A studios as well as small-scale indie developers can join in on the action by releasing their game, built with the Whiskr game engine plugin, to a large audience of excited gamers.

These games will include a wide variety from all genres as full-scale desktop games downloadable from, Catto, CoolCat's desktop client along with browser-based and mobile games in the future.

> One of the first games that will be released on CoolCat will be about CoolCat itself as the main character and an associated lore relating to the wider Cosmos ecosystem.

On-chain governance will allow any developer to apply for a grant to build their envisioned game after well thought-out feedback on the CoolCat Commonwealth. Rather than developers paying a fee to be listed as it is the norm in currently popular game stores, they will be able to be rewarded for their contribution to CoolCat in form of free publicity or monetary grants from the ever-filling CoolCat community pool.
To ensure the highest level of security for users of CoolCat, the deployment of games will be permissioned and decided on by all CoolCat stakers through an on-chain governance process. Before a governance proposal will be put up for vote, the gameâ€™s smart contracts will need to be audited by third party auditors, providing a higher level of assurance over the security and quality of the code that users interact with.
