- 10.0000.000.000 $CCAT

45% of the supply — 4.500.000.000 $CCAT — has been allocated to two airdrops in the future. The first of these is the initial launch of CoolCat, a.k.a the CatDrop, where we will be dropping a whopping 30% of the supply or 3.000.000.000 $CCAT to the community. In case that wasn’t enough to fill your bellies, our second CatDrop is scheduled as a gift in the holiday season later this year.

Development of the blockchain and game as well as payment and equipment for the hard work of all associated team members will be funded by 15% of the total supply or 1.500.000.000 $CCAT. These coins are vested on-chain for 5 years and will unlock gradually every 6 months for 10 total unlocks containing 1.5% of the total supply or 150.000.000 $CCAT. The entire amount of $CCAT vested on-chain is also staked to different validators from the start.

$CCAT allocated to the “Strategic Reserve” will be used to fund Giveaways and to vividly interact with our beloved community. A total of 500.000.000 $CCAT or 5% of the total supply is available from the start and will be heavily invested to onboard new cool cats on this unique journey.

The last 35% of the total supply or 3.500.000.000 $CCAT will be sent to the “Community Pool” where the community can, by governance, decide what these funds are spent on. This can include anything, and anyone with some $CCAT can create a proposal for their own ideas for the future of the project.
