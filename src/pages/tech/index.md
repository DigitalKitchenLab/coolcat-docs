The CoolCat network is powered by it's native cryptocurrency "CoolCat" ($CCAT).

## Cosmos SDK

The CoolCat blockchain is built using the Cosmos SDK. The Cosmos SDK is a framework made for creating layer 1 blockchains more secure and engaging than ever before.

## Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC)

IBC is the Cosmos ecosystem standard for blockchain interoperability. IBC enables independent blockchains to connect, transact, exchange tokens and other data, scale, and thrive in an interconnected network environment, enabling the CoolCat blockchain to tap into a rich ecosystem of endless possibilities.

## CosmWasm

All games on the CoolCat network are created using the CW-20 and CW-721 smart contract standard of CosmWasm 1.0 with a guaranteed succesfully completed audit by a third party before release. CosmWasm allows for smart contracts to be interoperable by default, enablng them to be used across IBC-connected blockchains.
