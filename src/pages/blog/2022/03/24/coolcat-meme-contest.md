😼 ATTENTION ALL COOLCATS ‼️
☀️ $CCAT giveaway season is well and truly underway!! ☀️

Off the back of our NFT Whitelist giveaway, the CoolCat team are pleased to announce our BRAND new giveaway. Continuing in the spirit of wanting to give back to our community, we are giving away a WHOPPING❕2,000,000❕$CCAT to TEN 🔟 lucky community members who choose to get involved in our latest contest.

🕰️ TIME FOR THE DETAILS! 🕰️

👀 Now, the most eagle eyed among you may have already noticed the hall of fame channel on our Discord. It’s a little empty for our liking, and so we are encouraging all of you, our CoolCats, to create a meme that is worthy of that space. Here are the explicit instructions:

Step 1️⃣ – Join our Discord or Telegram channels. The links can be found below.

Step 2️⃣ – Create your meme! Photos, videos, GIFS… all forms of digital content will be considered as an entry.

Step 3️⃣ – Send it to us through Telegram or Discord. Make sure to tag one of the admins so we can record your entry!

Step 4️⃣ – 10 entries will be shortlisted – then we will put it to a vote through Discord. Winners will receive 200,000 $CCAT each! 🎉

The winning pieces will become our first displays in the #hall-of-fame channel, and will be publicly available for any member of our community to view. So, get to work! You have just until Monday 11:59PM (CET)! Good luck, CoolCat!
