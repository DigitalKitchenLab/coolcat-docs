Concluding Science; Empowering Democracy
A lot of very heated discussions have happened in the Cosmos today as proposal #16 on the Juno network went into active voting period. If you want to read more about what has happened today â€” check out this Twitter thread.

As diehard fans of decentralisation the team at Digital Kitchen was coming together to discuss proposal #16 on Juno this morning. All team members agreed on taking stand with Core-1 and we are changing up our CatDrop requirements.

We decided on removing Osmosis ($OSMO) from the list of our CatDrop criteria in favour of increasing Cosmos Hub ($ATOM), Juno Network ($JUNO) and Chihuahua ($HUAHUA) airdrop allocation and also including two hidden bonus drops for active and decentralisation-favouring wallet addresses of the Cosmos Hub and Juno.

The minimum amount of Cosmos Hub ($ATOM) in active delegation is set to 7.77 ATOM spread across any validator. Staking to a specific validator is not required to be eligible for the CatDrop. CEX validators will be excluded from the snapshot. The minimum amount of Juno ($JUNO) in active delegation is set to 5.55 Juno. The minimum amount of Chihuahua ($HUAHUA) in active delegation is set to 69,420 HUAHUA.

A snapshot of each blockchain will happen randomly between Sunday, March 13th 12:00:00 AM CET and Friday, April 1st 11:59:59 PM CET. The bonus drop snapshots will be taken at each eventâ€™s planned block height.

An Update on Development
The development team has successfully implemented CosmWasm into the CoolCat blockchain, a new and very powerful smart contract language which also powers Junoâ€™s and soon many other Cosmos blockchains smart contracts. This will allow the CoolCat team to further develop interoperable cross-chain smart contracts on multiple blockchains starting with Juno in the future.
