Hello again Cool Cats and Kittens!
Weâ€™re blown away by the response weâ€™ve received to the announcement of our project, and your excitement is contagious. We can barely contain ourselves, even though right now, weâ€™re working round the clock to ensure our rollout is smoother than the pillow in your cat cave.
Either way, we wanted to get in the habit of keeping you guys in the loop with regular updates and announcements, and so we wanted to make sure all of you are aware of just how well the first week has gone.

So, some numbers.
Since our announcement, you guys have gone above and beyond what we expected, sharing our project to your furry friends around the world, and the results are in. In the first week, weâ€™ve reached 4,350 Twitter followers, over 1230 Discord members and just north of 900 users in our Telegram channel. Wow. We canâ€™t begin to thank you enough for your support, and we hope our continued work and effort in this project will be what you are hoping for.

CoolCat Communities
We are excited to announce that we have successfully set up several international communities for CoolCat all around the globe. These communities, led by native community managers, provide translations for every official CoolCat article and offer an opportunity for non-english speaking people to join the CoolCat community. You had trouble reading the article in English? Look back, the CoolCat Team translated the first two articles into several languages.

About Osmosis
Now that youâ€™ve heard the good news, we feel Itâ€™s time to recap on our decision to exclude Osmosis ($OSMO) from our #CatDrop requirement list. We did not mean any harm to the Osmosis community by excluding them from our airdrop but we had planned to increase the specification for the CatDrop right from the start which then was miscommunicated and incorrectly published at launch. The team saw a striking opportunity to create more interaction with the Cosmos community at large while also staying true to the initial #CatDrop plan so we used the controversial discussion around #prop16 to spice up the airdrop requirements.

Thatâ€™s all for this evening. Iâ€™ve got a lovely bowl of milk waiting for me. I hope your evening looks just as good. This is CoolCat â€“ signing off!
