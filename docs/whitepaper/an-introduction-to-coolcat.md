All games on the CoolCat network are created using the CW-20 and CW-721 smart contract standard of CosmWasm 1.0 with a guaranteed succesfully completed audit by a third party before release. CosmWasm allows for smart contracts to be interoperable by default, enablng them to be used across IBC-connected blockchains.
