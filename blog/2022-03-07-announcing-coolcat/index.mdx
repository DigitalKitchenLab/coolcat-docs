CoolCat is a play-to-earn proof-of-stake blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK. ⚛️+🎮+🐱=✨Greatness✨

In March 2022, the gates to the world of CoolCat are finally opening. A community-led Discord server and Telegram group where early community members can discuss, govern and meme about CoolCat’s upcoming features have been created.

<!--truncate-->

A little later, in April 2022, Digital Kitchen, in cooperation with our incredibly helpful set of validators, will launch the proof-of-stake CoolCat blockchain into it’s first version with a 💥BIG BANG💥. 45% of all at launch available coins will be dropped to users of the Cosmos ecosystem, specifically to cosmonauts staking ATOM on the Hub, scientists experimenting with OSMO on Osmosis, our rebellious builder friends over at Juno and also…ugh… dogs. Wallets staking $HUAHUA will also be eligible for the CoolCat CatDrop. Yeah. You’re welcome. To make things even more exciting, a polished and shiny user interface for Keplr and Ledger users will be available from the get-go.

With that said — the actual game release will happen once the team at Digital Kitchen decides the game is playable. Closed testing will happen regularly for active members of our official Discord server.

Finally, it’s time to get to why you’re here. It’s Tokenomics time. As mentioned above, 45% of the supply — 4.500.000.000 $CCAT — has been allocated to two airdrops in the future. The first of these is the initial launch of CoolCat, a.k.a the CatDrop, where we will be dropping a whopping 30% of the supply or 3.000.000.000 $CCAT to the community. In case that wasn’t enough to fill your bellies, our second CatDrop is scheduled as a gift in the holiday season later this year.

Development of the blockchain and game as well as payment and equipment for the hard work of all associated team members will be funded by 15% of the total supply or 1.500.000.000 $CCAT. These coins are vested on-chain for 5 years and will unlock gradually every 6 months for 10 total unlocks containing 1.5% of the total supply or 150.000.000 $CCAT. The entire amount of $CCAT vested on-chain is also staked to different validators from the start.
$CCAT allocated to the “Strategic Reserve” will be used to fund Giveaways and to vividly interact with our beloved community. A total of 500.000.000 $CCAT or 5% of the total supply is available from the start and will be heavily invested to onboard new cool cats on this unique journey.
The last 35% of the total supply or 3.500.000.000 $CCAT will be sent to the “Community Pool” where the community can, by governance, decide what these funds are spent on. This can include anything, and anyone with some $CCAT can create a proposal for their own ideas for the future of the project.

Next Steps
A full whitepaper, containing a detailed roadmap for further development on the blockchain and details on the first game to launch on CoolCat will be published in the very near future, until then, feel free to ask us any questions you might have regarding the project on the official channels.
